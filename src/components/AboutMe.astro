            When I'm not wrestling with code or chasing down elusive bugs,
            you'll find me cheering on my two energetic boys. My 10-year-old is
            a budding basketball star, always perfecting his shots, while my
            5-year-old loves to kick the ball around as he dreams of becoming a
            football pro. Our weekends are filled with laughter and competition
            as we support each other on and off the field.

          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I have a knack for enjoying good meals, and there's nothing quite
            like a night out at a restaurant. Whether it's a cozy family dinner
            or a fun night out, I relish the simple pleasure of enjoying
            familiar favorites without the hassle of cooking!
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            And when the creative urge strikes, I dive into my LEGO collection.
            We love picking out fun sets and building them together—because who
            doesn't enjoy following the instructions to create something
            awesome?
